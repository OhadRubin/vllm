It can also be a way of exposing your thought process, to let others see how you came to a particular conclusion.

      "line 03 | If you have chronic hives, you know all about the most defining characteristic of this skin condition: the itch. Medical experts often describe the hives as “pruritic wheals,” which in plain language means itchy welts that appear on your skin.\n",
      "line 04 | Chronic hives (urticaria) can be very frustrating and challenging to control. Besides causing discomfort, chronic hives can interfere with daily activities, but there are many ways to manage the condition even if you don’t know its cause.\n",
      "line 05 | What are Chronic Hives?\n",
      "line 06 | Hives are a common condition affecting approximately 25% of the population at some time. Urticaria is unpredictable and results in a great deal of distress because of the intense pruritis (itching), and the interference it causes to sleep and daily life. The fundamental step in managing urticaria is to classify the nature of the condition.\n",
      "line 07 | Types of hives include:\n",
      "line 08 | - Acute Urticaria. This rash lasts less than 6 weeks and is usually brought on by an adverse or allergic reaction to certain foods or medications.\n",
      "line 09 | - Chronic Urticaria. These rashes last for more than 6 weeks.\n",
      "line 10 | - Physical Urticaria. This is due to irritation of the skin. This rash rarely spreads beyond the original location.\n",
      "line 11 | - Dermatographism. This condition is when hives occur due to scratching or vigorously rubbing the skin.\n",
      "line 12 | What are the Symptoms?\n",
      "line 13 | While they resemble bug bites, hives (urticaria) are different in several ways:\n",
      "line 14 | - Hives can appear in any area of the body; they may change shape, move around, disappear and reappear over short periods of time.\n",
      "line 15 | - The bumps usually appear suddenly and go away just as quickly.\n",
      "line 16 | - Pressing the center of a red hive makes it turn white, a process called “blanching.”\n",
      "line 17 | How to Manage Chronic Hives?\n",
      "line 18 | Regardless of the specific characteristics, most people with chronic hives just want to find an effective treatment. Finding some relief understandably becomes your first priority. Get control of your itching by looking into the available treatment options.\n",
      "line 19 | One of the best ways to control hives is to avoid known triggers. To determine which triggers may be affecting you, the first step is to see your allergist. If one or more of these allergens is found to be the cause of your hives, your allergist will work with you to figure out ways to avoid exposure.\n",
      "line 20 | Reassess Your Skincare Products\n",
      "line 21 | Reassess all of the products that you use on your skin: your soap, lotion, deodorant, face cream, and perfume/cologne. Learn how to read labels and identify chemicals that are known to dry out or irritate the skin, including propylene, glycol, toluene, triclosan, formaldehyde, and sodium lauryl sulfate.\n",
      "line 22 | The first-line treatment for hives. These drugs work by suppressing histamine, a chemical produced by the immune system that instigates the symptoms of allergy.\n",
      "line 23 | Stress can trigger hives. If you feel stressed often, healthy ways to reduce your stress include exercising daily, meditating, and practicing mindfulness.\n",
      "line 24 | If antihistamines don’t help, your doctor might prescribe a corticosteroid. These drugs calm the immune system. That can make your hives less severe.\n",
      "line 25 | Soothe Your Skin\n",
      "line 26 | The drier you skin, the itchier it feels, tempting you to scratch. But scratching is one of the worst things you can do because it can aggravate your hives. To calm the itching, keep your skin moisturized. Taking frequent baths can also help reduce itching and scratching.\n",
      "line 27 | Wear Loose, Light Clothing\n",
      "line 28 | Constant friction and pressure on your skin can worsen your hives. Avoid wearing constricting clothing, tight belts, and even ill-fitting shoes, as hives can also occur on the soles of your feet.\n",
      "line 29 | Apply Cold Compress\n",
      "line 30 | You can apply a cool, damp cloth to the affected area. This can provide temporary relief from itchiness and help reduce inflammation. A cold compress can be used as often as necessary.\n",
      "line 31 | Take Vitamin D Supplement\n",
      "line 32 | Adding a vitamin D supplement to your treatment plan may help reduce the symptoms of chronic hives, according to a small study published in January 2014 in the Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology. Talk to your doctor about possibly adding a supplement to your treatment.\n",
      "line 33 | Life with chronic hive can be frustrating, especially if your symptoms prevent you from getting enough sleep and completing daily tasks. But there are several ways you can ease the itchiness and discomfort that comes with your condition.\n",
      "line 34 | A board-certified allergist will give you a thorough medical exam that can help rule out possible causes, such as infection or medication which could be causing your hives. They also recommend lifestyle changes and prescribe medication that can help reduce your flare-ups.\n",

      "Thought: \"But the term chronic can also mean recurrent.\"\n",
      "Thought: \"I'll assume they're referring to recurrent hives here.\"\n",
      "Thought: \"Yeah, this is talking about chronic hives.\"\n",
      "Thought: \"Ok, so they're saying that urticaria is unpredictable and results in distress.\"\n",
      "Thought: \"Urticaria is just the medical term for hives.\"\n",

      "The question of the meaning of life is one of the most profound and enduring questions in human history. It has been debated, explored, and pondered by philosophers, theologians, scientists, and everyday people for centuries.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is no one definitive answer to this question, as it can vary greatly depending on cultural, personal, and philosophical perspectives. However, here are some possible approaches to understanding the meaning of life:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Religious or spiritual perspectives**: Many people find meaning and purpose in their lives through their faith or spiritual practices. For example, Christians believe that the meaning of life is to love and serve God, while Buddhists believe that the purpose of life is to attain enlightenment and end suffering.\n",
      "2. **Humanistic perspectives**: From a humanistic perspective, the meaning of life is to pursue happiness, fulfillment, and self-actualization. This approach emphasizes the importance of individual freedom, creativity, and personal growth.\n",
      "3. **Existential perspectives**: Existentialists believe that life has no inherent meaning, and that it is up to each individual to create their own meaning and purpose. This approach emphasizes the importance of taking responsibility for one's choices and actions.\n",
      "4. **Scientific perspectives**: From a scientific perspective, the meaning of life can be understood as a complex interplay of biological, psychological, and social factors. This approach emphasizes the importance of understanding human behavior, cognition, and emotions.\n",
      "5. **Philosophical perspectives**: Philosophers have proposed various answers to the question of the meaning of life, including:\n",
      " * **Epicureanism**: The meaning of life is to seek happiness and avoid pain.\n",
      " * **Stoicism**: The meaning of life is to live in accordance with reason and virtue.\n",
      " * **Nihilism**: The meaning of life is non-existent, and life is inherently meaningless.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ultimately, the meaning of life is a deeply personal and subjective question that each individual must answer for themselves. While there are many possible approaches to understanding the meaning of life, there is no one \"right\" answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some possible ways to find meaning and purpose in life include:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Pursuing your passions**: Engage in activities that bring you joy and fulfillment.\n",
      "2. **Building meaningful relationships**: Nurture relationships with family, friends, and community.\n",
      "3. **Cultivating a sense of purpose**: Identify your values and goals, and work towards achieving them.\n",
      "4. **Practicing mindfulness and self-awareness**: Develop a deeper understanding of yourself and the world around you.\n",
      "5. **Embracing the present moment**: Focus on the here and now, rather than dwelling on the past or worrying about the future.\n",
      "\n",
      "Remember, the meaning of life is a journey, not a destination. It is a process of growth, exploration, and discovery that can evolve over time.\n"

      "Thought: \"Well, I guess that makes sense, India and Pakistan have a history of hostility.\"\n",
      "line 04 | since their inception, Pakistan and India are locked in an intractable conflict over acquiring prestige against each other. This conflict behaviour and the perception of enmity is directly informed by their indigenous culture of conflict found in the common institution of joint family. This article develops a conflict theory to explain the rationale behind such an emotion-laden rivalry between the two nations. The conflict theory presented in this article (which can be termed as Sharike-Bazi [Culture of Conflict]) explains that peoples’ conflict behaviours in Pakistan and India are rooted in their earliest socialisation within primary kinship institutions.\n",
      "Thought: \"But what's interesting is they say this 'conflict' is informed by something called 'indigenous culture of conflict'.\"\n",
      "Thought: \"I've never heard of that before, I wonder what they're talking about.\"\n",
      "Thought: \"Ok, here they define what they mean by 'indigenous culture of conflict'.\"\n",
      "Thought: \"They say it's found in something called 'joint family', which I assume means an extended family unit.\"\n",
      "Thought: \"Alright, so basically they're saying that Pakistanis and Indians learn from an early age how to fight and compete with each other in their families, and this shapes their attitudes towards each other as nations.\"\n",
      "Thought: \"That's an interesting theory, I wonder if they provide any evidence for it.\"\n",

      "Thought: \"Well, I suppose understanding the origins of conflict between nations is always important for trying to resolve it.\"\n",
      "Thought: \"But also, it's interesting to think about how culture influences politics and international relations.\"\n",
      "Thought: \"I'll come back to that later on.\"\n",
      "line 07 | India and Pakistan can be termed as ‘patient’ states suffering from deep-seated trauma of ‘separation’ from each other. They are prisoners of ‘I am not respected’ and ‘I am wronged’ syndromes, respectively. This paper has examined that the collective hysteria existing in both nations to hate and compete with each other has cultural origins, characteristics and mechanisms (or ‘operating system) emanating from their indigenous culture of conflict at the family level.\n",
      "Thought: \"Here they talk about how India and Pakistan are 'patients' suffering from deep 'separation' trauma.\"\n",
      "Thought: \"I'm not sure I agree with that analogy...it seems a bit overdramatic to me.\"\n",
      "Thought: \"But they do make the point that both countries have strong feelings of resentment towards each other.\"\n",

      "Thought: \"Ok, here they recommend reading the original paper for more detail.\"\n",

      "line 09 | This page is a summary of: Perceiving the Enemy Differently: A Psycho-cultural Analysis of Pakistan–India Conflict, Journal of Asian Security and International Affairs, June 2019, SAGE Publications, DOI: 10.1177/2347797019842445.\n",

      "Thought: \"Basically, it says that the way people think about and act towards each other as members of these two countries is shaped by specific ideas, beliefs, and behaviors that are rooted in their shared cultural background.\"\n",
      "Thought: \"And specifically, it says that the roots of this conflict can be found in the ways families are organized and function within Pakistani and Indian society.\"\n",
