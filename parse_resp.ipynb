It can also be a way of exposing your thought process, to let others see how you came to a particular conclusion.

This conflict behaviour and the perception of enmity is directly informed by their indigenous culture of conflict found in the common institution of joint family. This article develops a conflict theory to explain the rationale behind such an emotion-laden rivalry between the two nations. The conflict theory presented in this article (which can be termed as Sharike-Bazi [Culture of Conflict]) explains that peoples’ conflict behaviours in Pakistan and India are rooted in their earliest socialisation within primary kinship institutions.\n",

      "Thought: \"Well, I guess that makes sense, India and Pakistan have a history of hostility.\"\n",
      "Thought: \"But what's interesting is they say this 'conflict' is informed by something called 'indigenous culture of conflict'.\"\n",
      "Thought: \"I've never heard of that before, I wonder what they're talking about.\"\n",
      "Thought: \"Ok, here they define what they mean by 'indigenous culture of conflict'.\"\n",
      "Thought: \"They say it's found in something called 'joint family', which I assume means an extended family unit.\"\n",
      "Thought: \"Alright, so basically they're saying that Pakistanis and Indians learn from an early age how to fight and compete with each other in their families, and this shapes their attitudes towards each other as nations.\"\n",
      "Thought: \"That's an interesting theory, I wonder if they provide any evidence for it.\"\n",
      "Thought: \"Oh, I guess there's a photo too...I'm not sure what it has to do with the topic though.\"\n",
      "Thought: \"They ask why this is important...hmmm...\"\n",
      "Thought: \"Well, I suppose understanding the origins of conflict between nations is always important for trying to resolve it.\"\n",
      "Thought: \"But also, it's interesting to think about how culture influences politics and international relations.\"\n",
      "Thought: \"I'll come back to that later on.\"\n",
      "Thought: \"Here they talk about how India and Pakistan are 'patients' suffering from deep 'separation' trauma.\"\n",
      "Thought: \"I'm not sure I agree with that analogy...it seems a bit overdramatic to me.\"\n",
      "Thought: \"But they do make the point that both countries have strong feelings of resentment towards each other.\"\n",
      "Thought: \"That part at least sounds plausible to me.\"\n",
      "Thought: \"Ok, here they recommend reading the original paper for more detail.\"\n",

      "Thought: \"I'll have to look it up when I get home...\"\n",
      "Thought: \"Ok, now they summarize what the paper argues.\"\n",
      "Thought: \"Basically, it says that the way people think about and act towards each other as members of these two countries is shaped by specific ideas, beliefs, and behaviors that are rooted in their shared cultural background.\"\n",
      "Thought: \"And specifically, it says that the roots of this conflict can be found in the ways families are organized and function within Pakistani and Indian society.\"\n",
      "Thought: \"Again, that's a pretty interesting claim...I wonder where they get their data from?\"\n",
      "Thought: \"It looks like this page was written by someone named Dr. Shuja Nawaz, who is an author at SAGE.\"\n",

      "line 03 | What is it about?\n",
      "Thought: \"Hmmm...they say 'Pakistan' and 'India' are locked in some kind of 'conflict' since they started.\"\n",
      "Thought: \"Well, I guess that makes sense, India and Pakistan have a history of hostility.\"\n",
      "line 04 | since their inception, Pakistan and India are locked in an intractable conflict over acquiring prestige against each other. This conflict behaviour and the perception of enmity is directly informed by their indigenous culture of conflict found in the common institution of joint family. This article develops a conflict theory to explain the rationale behind such an emotion-laden rivalry between the two nations. The conflict theory presented in this article (which can be termed as Sharike-Bazi [Culture of Conflict]) explains that peoples’ conflict behaviours in Pakistan and India are rooted in their earliest socialisation within primary kinship institutions.\n",
      "Thought: \"But what's interesting is they say this 'conflict' is informed by something called 'indigenous culture of conflict'.\"\n",
      "Thought: \"I've never heard of that before, I wonder what they're talking about.\"\n",
      "Thought: \"Ok, here they define what they mean by 'indigenous culture of conflict'.\"\n",
      "Thought: \"They say it's found in something called 'joint family', which I assume means an extended family unit.\"\n",
      "Thought: \"Alright, so basically they're saying that Pakistanis and Indians learn from an early age how to fight and compete with each other in their families, and this shapes their attitudes towards each other as nations.\"\n",
      "Thought: \"That's an interesting theory, I wonder if they provide any evidence for it.\"\n",
      "line 05 | Photo by Specna Arms on Unsplash\n",
      "Thought: \"Oh, I guess there's a photo too...I'm not sure what it has to do with the topic though.\"\n",
      "line 06 | Why is it important?\n",
      "Thought: \"They ask why this is important...hmmm...\"\n",
      "Thought: \"Well, I suppose understanding the origins of conflict between nations is always important for trying to resolve it.\"\n",
      "Thought: \"But also, it's interesting to think about how culture influences politics and international relations.\"\n",
      "Thought: \"I'll come back to that later on.\"\n",
      "line 07 | India and Pakistan can be termed as ‘patient’ states suffering from deep-seated trauma of ‘separation’ from each other. They are prisoners of ‘I am not respected’ and ‘I am wronged’ syndromes, respectively. This paper has examined that the collective hysteria existing in both nations to hate and compete with each other has cultural origins, characteristics and mechanisms (or ‘operating system) emanating from their indigenous culture of conflict at the family level.\n",
      "Thought: \"Here they talk about how India and Pakistan are 'patients' suffering from deep 'separation' trauma.\"\n",
      "Thought: \"I'm not sure I agree with that analogy...it seems a bit overdramatic to me.\"\n",
      "Thought: \"But they do make the point that both countries have strong feelings of resentment towards each other.\"\n",
      "Thought: \"That part at least sounds plausible to me.\"\n",
      "line 08 | Read the Original\n",
      "Thought: \"Ok, here they recommend reading the original paper for more detail.\"\n",
      "Thought: \"I might do that myself actually...I'm curious to see what evidence they present for their claims.\"\n",
      "line 09 | This page is a summary of: Perceiving the Enemy Differently: A Psycho-cultural Analysis of Pakistan–India Conflict, Journal of Asian Security and International Affairs, June 2019, SAGE Publications, DOI: 10.1177/2347797019842445.\n",
      "Thought: \"Ah, here they give the citation for the original paper, looks like it was published by SAGE last year.\"\n",
      "Thought: \"I'll have to look it up when I get home...\"\n",
      "line 10 | You can read the full text:\n",
      "line 11 | The following have contributed to this page\n",
      "line 12 |  \n",
      "Thought: \"Ok, now they summarize what the paper argues.\"\n",
      "Thought: \"Basically, it says that the way people think about and act towards each other as members of these two countries is shaped by specific ideas, beliefs, and behaviors that are rooted in their shared cultural background.\"\n",
      "Thought: \"And specifically, it says that the roots of this conflict can be found in the ways families are organized and function within Pakistani and Indian society.\"\n",
      "Thought: \"Again, that's a pretty interesting claim...I wonder where they get their data from?\"\n",
      "Thought: \"It looks like this page was written by someone named Dr. Shuja Nawaz, who is an author at SAGE.\"\n",
      "Thought: \"Might be worth looking him up, see if he has other work on this topic.\"\n",
      "Thought: \"Alright, I think that covers everything in this excerpt.\"\n"
